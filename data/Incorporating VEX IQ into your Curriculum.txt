After practicing their coding, engineering, or strategy skills, students will move into the Compete section. Here they will participate in a full classroom competition. These competitions offer authentic applications; giving the students a way for them to understand the changing world around them through computational thinking and engineering constructs. For more information about implementing a VEX IQ (2nd generation) STEM Lab Unit in your classroom, see this article. [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409682120724-Implementing-STEM-Lab-Units-with-VEX-IQ-2nd-gen-]

Through competition participation, students are encouraged to iterate and experiment with their code, to try new things, and to actively learn from others. The goal is not simply accomplishing the task, but creating a solution that works better, faster, or more efficiently than other possible solutions.

Students can compete against each other in pairs, groups or the entire class. No matter how you want to implement your classroom competition, there is support for Facilitating an IQ STEM Lab Competition [https://kb.vex.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404983247636-Facilitating-an-IQ-STEM-Lab-Competition] that you can follow. Each IQ Education Bundle contains everything you need, including configurable game fields and game objects. These fields assemble quickly in a variety of shapes and sizes, perfect for any classroom layout.


SPARK STEM LABS

SPARK STEM Labs challenge students through another set process. These STEM Labs are written for use with VEX IQ (1st generation) Kits. SPARK STEM Labs follow a sequence of learning experiences. The learner is asked to do the following:

 * Create a build or an artifact.
 * Explore the build or the artifact and speculate as to its possible application in the real world.
 * Learn by doing.
 * Make changes to a design or a build to improve and enhance it.
 * Assess knowledge.

In the Seek section, students build their robot by following a set of build instructions. Then students move into the Play sections where they follow guided instruction to explore the new skill or concept introduced. In Apply, students will read about the real world and competition connections to the concepts they are learning about. In Rethink, students are given a challenge. They will need to apply their knowledge from Play and work collaboratively with their groups to solve the challenge. Finally in Know, students can check their understanding with questions.


WHAT ARE ACTIVITIES?

SUGGESTED PLANNING STRATEGIES

The VEX IQ platform can be well executed in a variety of ways, thus making it a valuable tool in a variety of learning environments. These highly engaging STEM materials give it a significant role in the success of a school and its students and teachers.

Consider the following as you plan to implement VEX IQ in your educational space:

 * What is your time frame and/or setting? STEM Labs can give you ideas for how to guide students through creating a project or experimenting with a build. Activities can give you ideas for more independent student explorations or challenges. Are there any space constraints that you have that might affect your activities?
   * Use the VEX IQ Pacing Guide [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QmNfN8X9Trpr8UhcZAGPa-akSaPDrFxsoluerQ0AMQk/edit#gid=277290212] to help you plan your curriculum like in the examples below: 
     * If you are teaching a one semester beginner VEX IQ class, you may want to start with the Beginner IQ STEM Labs and corresponding VEX IQ Activities.
     * If you are teaching a one semester advanced Robotics class, you may want to do a quick refresh of skills by completing a few Activities, and then move into more intermediate/advanced STEM Labs such as Castle Crasher or Clawbot with Controller.
     * What balance of direct instruction and open-ended or hands-on exploration do you wish to have? Will you give students an Activity to follow on their own, or will you guide them through the experience as a whole group?
 * How will students be introduced to the concept or project? Will you use the setup of a STEM Lab to help you engage students, or will they watch a tutorial video to begin class? What prior experience can you draw on to help your students make a personal connection to the lesson content?
 * How will you wrap up class? Will there be a closing ceremony for the end of the classroom competition? How will students express their voice and choice to share their learning?
